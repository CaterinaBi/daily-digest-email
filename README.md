# A Daily digest e-mail generator intended for cycling lovers üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How to practice your newly-acquired Python skills? Nothing better than a nice personal project to get some designing and coding done!

And how to find a nice topic? Something that will keep you motivated? A present for a loved one could be the answer.

‚û°Ô∏è Here, I will be developing a daily digest e-mail generator for my husband, who's a keen cyclist, and his rider friends.

üíª Feel free to fork the repo and create your own version of the Daily digest for whomever might like it üíª
